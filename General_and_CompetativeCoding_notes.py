    General Notes:
    - Complexity Classes

    Concepts to Learn:
    - Turing Machines
    - Complexity Classes
    - Time Complexity
    - Hash Maps
    - Generate C++ Notes for all the python Notes you take after competition


    General Approach to each problem:
     - When solving 
         - Try as many differenet approaches to the problem as possible
         - Think through the logic of the problem
         - Code it
         - Fully Develop idea before writing code
         - Fully understand problem before writing code
         - If you are stuck for more than an hour look at answer
         


     - After failing to solve a problem
         - Think how you could have come up with the solution
         - Common ideas/alterante solutions
         - what angles to think the next time the problem comes up
         - Focus on the way to think instead of the solution

    Topic: Bitwise XOR Operation
    
    Explantion: 
        A bitwise XOR is a binary operation that takes two bit patterns of equal length and 
    performs the logical exclusive OR operation on each pair of corresponding bits. The 
    result in each position is 1 if only one of the bits is 1, but will be 0 if both are 0 or both are 1


        0101 (decimal 5)
    XOR 0011 (decimal 3)
      = 0110 (decimal 6)
    
    Applications:
        encryption, compression, graphics, communications over 
    ports/sockets, embedded systems programming and finite state machines

    # Notes

    - /n is always faster than endl
    - long long is larger than int and can go upto 2^64
    - Make sure to check negatives when usin Mod
    - Use Shorter Variable Names
